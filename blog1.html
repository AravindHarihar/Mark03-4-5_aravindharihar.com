        <h2>Yes, you read that right!</h2>
        <p>
            I did my graduation in Civil Engineering but now I am learning web development.
            <br><br>
            What? Why? How?  you will know in this blog.
        </p>

         <br>

         <h2>Why I chose Civil Engineering?</h2>
         <p>I was really passionate about large buildings, bridges, dams, etc, and always wondered how they're built. <br> My interest gradually increased as I researched more and more about it.
            Moreover, I did not have enough marks in 12th to choose options like CS, EC, etc.
        </p>

        <p>I thoroughly enjoyed my time in college and loved studying civil. So much so that, I was among the class toppers and in some subjects, I was among the top scorers in the entire University!
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2> Luck or effort?</h2>

        <span class="highlighted-text"></span>

        <p>When I was in my final year, there were many IT companies that came for campus placements.
            I wanted to experience a corporate interview once in my life and also was getting free attendance if I went to the interview, so I thought, <span class="highlighted-text">Why Not?</span> </p>
        <br>

        <p>First I had to give the aptitude test and I cleared it easily. Then there was a HR round.
            I cleared this round too very easily. And guess what? I got the offer letter!
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>But it did not matter to me as I was very clear that I will NOT join any IT company.
            Why? because civil was love ❤️ .
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2> What changed my mind?</h2>

        <p>
            During the final days of my college, I started a small startup with my friends.
            It was a matrimonial website for a very small community in Bangalore.
        </p>

        <p>
            I took in-charge of the product and my friends took up different roles like marketing, social media, etc,
        </p>



        <p>
            While the website was being developed I used to go to the developer often and used to discuss various ideas with him. <br> During this process, I started to understand the <span class="highlighted-text">power of code</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The code he wrote, could support even 10,000 users every day, this made me think about the impact and reach of a website or an app. 
            We could reach even a million people just by sitting in our rooms.
        </p>

        <p>
            I started to understand that no matter what building I construct, I cannot have that <span class="highlighted-text">level of impact</span> . This whole process inclined me towards pursuing a career in this field.
        </p>

        <p>So I decided to join the company in which I was placed.</p>


        <h2>My First Job</h2>

        <p>
            Once I joined the company, I was given training in languages like Java and Python.
            Guess what? I failed the Java exam. <br> I started to feel this isn't my cup of tea.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            with a lot of effort, I was able to clear the exams. Then I was put into QA.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            When I was in QA, I understood how products work end-to-end. This gave me a clear picture of how software is managed and how it is built from scratch. Over the period of 2 years I enjoyed this process and now I feel it is time to create something!
        </p>

        <p>
            Create for myself, for clients, and for open source.
        </p>
        <span class="highlighted-text">Code and media has high impact, and I want to make an impact on the world!</span>

        <h2 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 5rem;">That's all folks!</h2>
